### Overview

c-structs is a cross-platform implementation of classic data structures written in C99:

* Variable-length array
* Circular buffer
* Map (ordered/unordered)
* N-ary tree
* Adjacency graph

Structures are contained within their respective typedefs, and are queriable via relevant function calls. Data is stored on the heap and requires only the `stdlib.h` and `string.h` standard library headers.

### Building

##### Dependencies

Building this project requires the following dependencies:

* CMake (>= version 3.10)
* Ninja
* gcc (std=c99)
* binutils

##### Build Scripts

Following standard CMake conventions, in the root directory of this project are two scripts: `configure` and `build`. The project can be built using the following command:

```
./configure && ./build
```

##### Binaries

After building the project, binaries will be located in the `out/src/` subdirectory. The library file, libstructs.a, is in this directory, and demo applications are in the `demo/` subdirectory.

### Usage

Documentation for this project has been generated by Doxygen and can be found on the [GitHub Pages](https://bdreece.github.io/c-structs/) for c-structs.

### Credits

Big thanks to me for dedicating time to this. Hopefully I find some use out of it. Probably gonna pick a license soon just cause.
